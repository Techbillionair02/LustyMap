# LustyMap
LustyMap (Regime Edition) is a minimal, compile-safe skeleton rebuild of the original LustyMap by k1lly0u, reconstructed and corrected by Regime Gaming. This version restores missing structures, removes modern C# features incompatible with Oxide/Mono, fixes broken types, and provides a stable foundation to rebuild full LustyMap functionality.
